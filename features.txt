-------------------Key Components---------------------
- A scraper 
- An html response checker
- A method to go user by user and look at all of their links, then run them through the response checker

-------------------Decisions to Make-------------------
- GUI(simple way for people to check their submission links)
    - They could enter their HN username, then we would get a link to all of their submissions
    - We would just run through all of the their previous post links, and return a message about link status
- Instead of someone coming to our app to type in their user, we could try to scrap all users in a batch
    - We would need a way to contact them though, which is a problem on HN
